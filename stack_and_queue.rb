# Abstract Type
# Data Structures

# Describing a Type by what it does and not what it is. A hash is a key value store.

# Stack (LiFo) - Last in, first out
# Examples of stack:
#  - $PATH
#  - Ruby method lookup
#  - The 'stack trace' you see when an error occurs
#  Stacks respond to:
#  - push (add to end of collection)
#  - pop (remove from end of collection)
#  - length
my_stack = []            # => []
my_stack.push("Travis")  # => ["Travis"]
my_stack.push("Karly")   # => ["Travis", "Karly"]
my_stack.push("Justin")  # => ["Travis", "Karly", "Justin"]
my_stack.push("Ben")     # => ["Travis", "Karly", "Justin", "Ben"]
my_stack.length          # => 4

my_stack.pop     # => "Ben"
my_stack.pop     # => "Justin"
my_stack.pop     # => "Karly"
my_stack.pop     # => "Travis"
my_stack.pop     # => nil
my_stack.length  # => 0

# Queue (FiFo) - First in, first out
# Examples of queue:
# - waiting list for a meetup
# - message sending system
# - alert notifications
# - Drive-thru at a burger joint
# Queue respond to:
# - shift (remove first from collection)
# - push (add to end of collection)
# - length
waitlist = []           # => []
waitlist.push("Sarah")  # => ["Sarah"]
waitlist.push("Sally")  # => ["Sarah", "Sally"]
waitlist.push("Jo")     # => ["Sarah", "Sally", "Jo"]
waitlist.push("Brian")  # => ["Sarah", "Sally", "Jo", "Brian"]
waitlist.length         # => 4
waitlist.shift          # => "Sarah"
waitlist.shift          # => "Sally"
waitlist.shift          # => "Jo"
waitlist.length         # => 1
